## v8.0.5 (2023-03-02)

- fix(pipe-parser): Search for pipe in structural directives [#1](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/ngx-translate-extract/pull/1)

  This fix will now detect the pipe in code like this:

  ```
  <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="section; context: {
    title: 'example.translation.key' | translate
  }"></ng-container>
  ```

- fix: Find uses of translate pipe in pipe arguments [#2](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/ngx-translate-extract/pull/2)

  Fixes the following:


  ```angular2html
  {{ 'value' | testPipe: ('test1' | translate) }} // finds nothing, misses 'test1'
  {{ 'Hello' | translate: {world: ('World' | translate)} }} // finds 'Hello', misses 'World'
  {{ 'previewHeader' | translate:{filename: filename || ('video' | translate)} }} // finds 'previewHeader', misses 'video'
  ```
